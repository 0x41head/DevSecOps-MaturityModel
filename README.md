# Introduction
From a startup to a multinational corporation the software development industry is currently dominated by agile frameworks and product teams and as part of it DevOps strategies. It has been observed that during the implementation, security aspects are usually neglected or are at least not sufficient taken account of. It is often the case that standard safety requirements of the production environment are not utilized or applied to the build pipeline in the continuous integration environment with containerization or concrete docker. Therefore, the docker registry is often not secured which might result in the theft of the entire companyâ€™s source code.

The OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model, which is presented in the talk, shows security measures which are applied when using DevOps strategies and how these can be prioritized. 

With the help of DevOps strategies security can also be enhanced. For example, each component such as application libraries and operating system libraries in docker images can be tested for known vulnerabilities. 

Attackers are intelligent and creative, equipped with new technologies and purpose. Under the guidance of the forward-looking DevSecOps Maturity Model, appropriate principles and measures are at hand implemented which counteract the attacks.

# Credits
* The dimension _Test and Verifiacation_ is based on Christian Schneiders [Security DevOps Maturity Model (SDOMM)](https://www.christian-schneider.net/SecurityDevOpsMaturityModel.html). _Application tests_ and _Infrastructure tests_ are added by Timo Pagel. Also, the sub-dimension _Static depth_ has been evaluated by security experts at [OWASP Stammtisch Hamburg](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_German_Chapter_Stammtisch_Initiative/Hamburg).
* The sub-dimension <i>Process</i> has been added after a discussion with [Francois Raynaud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francoisraynaud/) that reactive activities are missing.
* Enhancement of my basic translation is performed by [Claud Camerino](https://github.com/clazba).
