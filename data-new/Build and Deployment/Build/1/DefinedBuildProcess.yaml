risk: Performing builds without a defined process is error prone. For example, as
  a result of incorrect security related configuration.
measure: A well defined build process lowers the possibility of errors during the
  build process.
evidence: The build process is defined in <a href="REPLACE-ME">REPLACE-ME Pipeline</a>
  in the folder <i>vars</>. Projects are using a <i>Jenkinsfile</i> to use the defined
  process.
