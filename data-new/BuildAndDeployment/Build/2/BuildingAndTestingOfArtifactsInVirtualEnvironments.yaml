title: Building and testing of artifacts in virtual environments
risk: While building and testing artifacts, third party systems, application frameworks
  and 3rd party libraries are used. These might be malicious as a result of vulnerable
  libraries or because they are altered during the delivery phase.
measure: Each step during within the build and testing phase is performed in a separate
  virtual environments, which is destroyed afterward.
meta:
  implementationGuide: Depending on your envirnoment, usage of virtual machines or
    container technoligy is a good way. After the build, the filesystem should not
    be used again in other builds.
