title: Handover of confidential parameters
risk: Attackers who compromise a system can see confidential access information like
  database credentials. Parameters are often used to set credentials, for example
  by starting containers or applications. These parameters can often be seen by any
  one listing running processes on the target system.
measure: By using encryption, it is harder to read credentials , e.g. from the file
  system. Also, the usage of a credential management system can help protect credentials.
