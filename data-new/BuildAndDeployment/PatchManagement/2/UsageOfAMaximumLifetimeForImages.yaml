id: UsageOfAMaximumLifetimeForImages
title: Usage of a maximum lifetime for images
risk: Vulnerabilities in images of running containers stay for too long and might
  get exploited. Long running containers have potential memory leaks. A compromised
  container might get killed by restarting the container (e.g. in case the attacker
  has not reached the persistence layer).
measure: The periodically built images are deployed minimum every 30 days (better
  hourly/daily/weekly). Meaning an image is not in production for longer than 30 days.
