title: Usage of a short maximum lifetime for images
risk: Vulnerabilities in running containers stay for too long and might get exploited.

implementation:
- Sample concept:<br/>(1) each container has a set lifetime and is killed / replaced
  with a new container multiple times a day where you have some form of a graceful
  replacement to ensure no (short) service outage will occur to the end users.<br/>(2)
  twice a day a rebuild of images is done. The rebuilds are put into a automated testing
  pipeline. If the testing has no blocking issues the new images will be released
  for deployment during the next "restart" of a container. What has to be done, is
  to ensure the new containers are deployed in some canary deployment manner, this
  will ensure that if (and only if) something buggy has been introduced which breaks
  functionality the canary deployment will make sure the "older version" is being
  used and not the buggy newer one.
