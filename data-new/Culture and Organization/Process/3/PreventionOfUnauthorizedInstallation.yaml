risk: Unapproved components are used.
measure: Components must be whitelisted. Regular scans on the docker infrastructure
  (e.g. cluster) need to be performed, to verify that only standardized base images
  are used.

implementation: 'Example: All docker images used by teams need to be based on standard
  images.'
comment: By preventing teams from trying out new components, innovation might be hampered
