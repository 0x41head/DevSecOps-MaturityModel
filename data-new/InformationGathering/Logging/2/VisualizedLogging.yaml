title: Visualized logging
risk: System and application protocols are not visualized properly which leads to
  no or very limited logging assessment. Specially developers might have difficulty
  to read applications logs with unusually tools like the Linux tool 'cat'
measure: Protocols are visualized in a simple to use real time monitoring system.
  The GUI gives the ability to search for special attributes in the protocol.
