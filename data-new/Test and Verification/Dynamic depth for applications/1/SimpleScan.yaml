risk: Deficient security tests are performed. Simple vulnerabilities are not detected
  and missing security configurations (e.g. headers) are not set. Fast feedback is
  not given.
measure: A simple scan is performed to get a security baseline. In case the test is
  done in under 10 minutes, it should be part of the build and deployment process.
