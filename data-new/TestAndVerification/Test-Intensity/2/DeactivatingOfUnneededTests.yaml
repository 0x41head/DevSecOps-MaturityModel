risk: As tools cover a wide range of different vulnerability tests, they might not
  match the used components. Therefore, they need more time and resources as they
  need and the feedback loops takes too much time.
measure: Unneeded tests are deactivated. For example in case the service is using
  a Mongo database and no mysql database, the dynamic scan doesn't need to test for
  sql injections.
