Build:
  Building and testing of artefacts in virtual environments:
    risk: While building and testing artefacts, third party systems, application frameworks
      and 3rd party libraries are used. These might be malicious as a result of vulnerable
      libraries or because they are altered during the delivery phase.
    measure: Each step during within the build and testing phase is performed in a separate virtual
      environments, which is destroyed afterward.

  Defined build process:
    risk: Performing builds without a defined process is error prone.
      For example, as a result of incorect security related configuration.
    measure: A well defined build process lowers the possibility of errors during the build
      process.

  Regular tests:
    risk: After pushing source code to the version control system, any elay in receiving feedback on defects makes them harder for the developer to remediate. 
    measure: On each push and/or at given intervals automatic security tests are performed.

  Signing of code:
    risk: Unauthorized manipulation of source code might be difficult to spot.
    measure: Digitally signing commits helps to prevent unauthorized manipulation of source code.

  Signing of artefacts:
    risk: Unauthorized manipulation of artefacts might be difficult to spot. For example, this may result in
      images with malicious code in the Docker registry.
    measure: Digitally signing artefacts for all steps during the build and specally docker images, helps to ensure their integrity.

Deployment:
  Backup before deployment:
    risk: If errors are experienced during the deployment process you want to deploy
      an old release. However, due to changes in the database this is often unfeasible.
    measure: Performing automated backups before deployment can help facilitate deployments whilst testing the backup restore processes.

  Blue/Green Deployment:
    risk: A new artefact version can have unknown defects.
    measure: By having multiple production environments, a deployment can be performent
      on the first environment to spot possible defects before it is deployment in the production environment(s)

    samm2: TODO
  Defined deployment process:
    risk: Deployments without a defined process are error prone thus allowing old or untested artefact to be deployed.

  Environment depending configuration parameters:
    risk: Attackers who compromise source code can see confidential access information
      like database credentials.

      code.

  Handover of confidential parameters:
    risk: Attackers who compromise a system can see confidential access information
      like database credentials. Parameters are often used to set credentials, for
      example by starting containers or applications. These parameters can often be
      seen by any one listing running processes on the target system.
    measure: By using encryption, it is harder to read credentials , e.g.
      from the file system. Also, the usage of a credential management system can help
      protect credentials.

  Rolling update on deployment:
    risk: While a deployment is performed, the application can not be reached.
    measure: A deployment without downtime is performed*.

  Same artefact for environments:
    risk: Building of an artefact for different environments means that an untested
      artefact might reach the production environment.
    measure: Building an artefact once and deploying it to different environments means
      that only tested artefacts are allowed to reach the production environment

  Usage of feature toggles:
    risk: By using environment dependent configuration, some parameters will not be
      tested correctly. i.e. <pre>if
      (host == 'production') {} else {}</pre>
    measure: Usage of environment independend configration parameter, called feature
      toggles, helps to enhance the test coverage.

  Usage of trusted images:
    risk: Developers or operations might start random images in the production cluster which have malicous code or known vulnerabilities.
    Measure: Whitelist signed artificats/images or whitelist a trusted (internal) registry.
    implementation: Kubernetes Admission Controller can whitelist registries and/or whitelist a signing key.

  Inventory of running artifacts:
    risk: In case a vulnerability of severity high or critical exists, it needs to be known where an artifacts with that vulnerability is deployed with which dependencies.
    Measure: A documented inventory or a possibility to gather the needed information (e.g. the documentation of which script needs to be run by whoom) must be in place.
    implementation: Kubernetes Admission Controller can whitelist registries and/or whitelist a signing key.
