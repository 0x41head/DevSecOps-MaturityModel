  Nightly build of images:
    risk: Vulnerabilities in running containers stay for too long and might get exploited.
    measure: Images are getting build at least nightly.

  Usage of a maximum life for containers:
    risk: Vulnerabilities in running containers stay for too long and might get exploited.
    measure: The nightly builded images are deployed minimum every 30 days. Meaning a container does not lives longer than 30 days.

  Usage of a short maximum life for containers:
    risk: Vulnerabilities in running containers stay for too long and might get exploited.
    measure: The nightly builded images are deployed minimum every 1 day. Meaning a container does not lives longer than 1 day.
