### Talk Descriptions
#### Key Steps to Achieving an Application Security Program
This talk outlines a practical approach to building and optimizing application security (AppSec) programs for organizations of all sizes. 
While briefly touching on foundational elements, the presentation focuses on developing and implementing a custom organizational maturity model that resonates with development and operations teams. Moving beyond traditional frameworks, attendees will learn to design tailored models that account for diverse operating environments. The talk provides strategies for avoiding common pitfalls, implementing effective metrics, and creating a scalable AppSec approach adaptable to an organizationâ€™s evolving needs. Through actionable advice and real-world examples, participants will gain insights applicable to both new and existing AppSec programs.

#### Conversation about Application Security Program Experiences
Brook and Timo will talk about their experiences with Application Security Programs.
Everyone is invited to join the conversation. Please bring your questions!

#### Reach your Dynamic Depth with OWASP secureCodeBox

#### Workshop: Utilizing DSOMM app to define your own program
Get to know the DSOMM application and how to customize it to distribute your AppSec Program as a maturity model.

Requirements:
- Docker

Linux is recommended.

#### Workshop: Application and Vulnerability maturity Model (VMM) - DSOMM Map
Organizations face an ever-increasing risk of cyberattacks and data breaches. Vulnerabilities are getting discovered faster than ever, with a 34% YoY increase of vulnerability discovery. Vulnerabilities are often tackled as they come from security scanners, leading to burnout of security professionals, with 50% of security engineers considering changing their profession entirely. This workshop explores the vulnerability management process that applies to application, cloud, and infrastructure security.

To mitigate these risks, vulnerability management and triage have become essential components of an effective cybersecurity program. Vulnerability triage, in particular, plays a critical role in identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities to minimize the organization's attack surface across applications, cloud and infrastructure. However, the process of vulnerability triage is not a one-size-fits-all approach and requires a maturity model that reflects the organization's current state of readiness. In this workshop, you will explore the evolution of vulnerability management and triage process maturity and how organizations can enhance their capabilities to manage and mitigate cybersecurity risks effectively.

Why we created the vulnerability management process?
We created the vulnerability maturity model to provide a quick and easy assessment method to define where you are in the vulnerability assessment process from triage.
The VMM is mapped back to both SAMM, and DSOMM.

## Speakers

#### Bio Brook
Brook is the author of "Secrets Of A Cyber Security Architect" (Auerbach, 2019) and "Securing Systems: Applied Security Architecture and Threat Models" (CRC Press, 2015), co-author of "Building In Security At Agile Speed" (Auerbach, 2021) and contributing author to "Core Software Security" (CRC Press, 2014). Brook is a passionate security architect with decades of technical leadership experience. Currently providing security architecture leadership for three security consultancies, Brook is also an advisor to True Positives, LLC and Resilient Software Security, LLC. Brook supplies technical leadership and strategy to the consultancies as well as contributes to clients' holistic software security programmes and secure design/threat modeling efforts.
Brook is interested in rethinking approaches to security problems, questioning assumptions and current "industry practices" wisdom. Brook hopes that many of the more intractable security problems can begin to be solved with architectural approaches, by making security part of the architecture fabric of systems and interconnectedness.
