      measure: By understanding and documenting a business continuity and disaster
        recovery (BCDR) plan, the overall availability of systems and applications
        is increased. Success factors like responsibilities, Service Level Agreements,
        Recovery Point Objectives, Recovery Time Objectives or Failover must be fully
        documented and understood.
      name: Definition of simple BCDR practices for critical components
      risk:
      - In case of an emergency, like a power outage, DR actions to perform are not
        clear. This leads to reaction and remediation delays.

      measure: On each new version (e.g. Pull Request) of source code or infrastructure
        components a security peer review of the changes is performed (two eyes principle)
        and approval given by the reviewer.
      name: Approval by reviewing any new version
      risk:
      - An individual might forget to implement security measures to protect source
        code or infrastructure components.

      measure: Components must be whitelisted. Regular scans on the docker infrastructure
        (e.g. cluster) need to be performed, to verify that only standardized base
        images are used.
      name: Prevention of unauthorized installation
      risk:
      - Unapproved components are used.
