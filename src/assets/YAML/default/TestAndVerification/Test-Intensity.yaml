      risk:
      - A too small intensity or a too high confidence might lead to not visible vulnerabilities.

      measure: On each push and/or at given intervals automatic security tests are
        performed.
      name: Regular tests
      risk:
      - After pushing source code to the version control system, any delay in receiving
        feedback on defects makes them harder for the developer to remediate.

      measure: Unneeded tests are deactivated. For example in case the service is
        using a Mongo database and no mysql database, the dynamic scan doesn't need
        to test for sql injections.
      name: Deactivating of unneeded tests
      risk:
      - As tools cover a wide range of different vulnerability tests, they might not
        match the used components. Therefore, they need more time and resources as
        they need and the feedback loops takes too much time.

      measure: A testing concept considering the amount of time per scan/intensity
        is created and applied. A dynamic analysis needs more time than a static analysis.
        The dynamic scan, depending on the test intensity might be performed on every
        commit, every night, every week or once in a month.
      name: Creation and application of a testing concept
      risk:
      - Scans might use a too small or too high test intensity.
